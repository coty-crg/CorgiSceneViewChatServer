# CorgiSceneViewChatServer
This is the git repo for the server code of the Unity Asset Store plugin Corgi SceneView Chat. This repo is provided as an alternative to connecting to my personal server. Feel free to use this to run your own. I am not providing active support for the server code - you're on your own.
